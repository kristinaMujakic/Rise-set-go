#Capstone Project Proposal - Rise Set Go

##Goal of the Website
The main goal of this application is to provide users with information about the Sun and Moon at the requested time, including sunrise, sunset, day length, moonrise, and moonset.

##Demographic of Users
This website targets anyone who wants to plan their activities, such as fishing, weight loss (moon diet), photography during the "golden hour," hiking, or simply enjoying a specific sunrise or sunset.

##Data to be Used
The Astronomy API from https://ipgeolocation.io/documentation/astronomy-api.html will be used to retrieve the location-based rise and set times for both the Sun and Moon.

##Approach to Creating the Project
Database Schema
A database schema will be created to store user information, location information, and other necessary data.

##Possible Issues
The API data may not always be accurate due to atmospheric conditions, precision of location data, or different time zones. Additionally, if the API's external data sources have issues, it will affect the API itself.

##Sensitive Information to Secure
Users' passwords will be hashed using a secure hashing algorithm when they create or update their accounts.

##Functionality of the App
The website will have the following functionality:

*User authentication
*Location search
*Location saving

##User Flow
The following user flow is expected:

Homepage
1.Sign in / log in
2.Location search
3.Location saving
4.Log out

##Features

Users can share desired information (sunrise, etc.) on a social media platform, such as a hiking group.
